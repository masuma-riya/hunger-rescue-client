## Overview

Hunger Rescue is a food donation website that serves as a community for Food Sharing and Surplus Reduction. It provides a user-friendly interface where donors can easily add food items and view their donation history. Similarly, individuals seeking assistance can browse available food items, request specific items, and monitor the status of their requests.

## Features

- **Food Donation and Request**:

  - Donors can add any food items to the platform and manage their contributions. They have access to a personalized dashboard where they can view the food items they have donated and track their donation history.
  - Users in need can request food items from the available selection. They can browse through the list of available items, request specific foods, and track the status of their requests.

- **Available Foods Page**:

  - The Available Foods page showcases all food items added by donors that are currently available for donation. It provides a comprehensive list of available items, allowing users to browse, filter, and search for specific foods.

- **Request Fulfillment**:

  - When a user requests a food item, the requested item is promptly removed from the available foods page to prevent duplicate requests. Simultaneously, it is added to the requester's request page for easy tracking and monitoring.

- **Dynamic Food Status**:

  - The status of food items dynamically changes from "available" to "requested" when a request is made. This ensures that other users are aware of the current availability status of each food item, promoting transparency and efficiency in the donation process.
